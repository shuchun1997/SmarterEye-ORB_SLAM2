1. Download [SmarterEye-ORBSLAM2-SDK][] and follow steps to install.
2. Follow the normal procedure to install ORB_SLAM2.
3. run examples by Infinite2 camera.

# 2. Prerequisites
We have tested the library in **Ubuntu 16.04**, and **18.04**, but it should be easy to compile in other platforms. A powerful computer (e.g. i7) will ensure real-time performance and provide more stable and accurate results.

## C++11 or C++0x Compiler
We use the new thread and chrono functionalities of C++11.

## Pangolin
We use Pangolin for visualization and user interface. 
step1:
sudo apt-get install libglew-dev
sudo apt-get install cmake
sudo apt-get install libpython2.7-dev
sudo apt-get install ffmpeg libavcodec-dev libavutil-dev libavformat-dev libswscale-dev libavdevice-dev
sudo apt-get install libdc1394-22-dev libraw1394-dev
sudo apt-get install libjpeg-dev libpng12-dev libtiff5-dev libopenexr-dev

step2: 
Dowload and install instructions can be found at: https://github.com/stevenlovegrove/Pangolin.

step3:
cd Pangolin
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
##j后面是CPU的核心数量，适当修改，主要是为了编译加速
make -j4 
sudo make install 


## OpenCV
We use OpenCV to manipulate images and features. 
step1:
Dowload and install  at: http://opencv.org. **Required at leat 3 Tested with OpenCV 3.4.5**.

step2:
sudo apt-get install build-essential libgtk2.0-dev libavcodec-dev libavformat-dev libjpeg.dev libtiff4.dev libswscale-dev libjasper-dev

step3:
cd opencv
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RELEASE -D CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/local -D WITH_TBB=ON -D BUILD_NEW_PYTHON_SUPPORT=ON -D WITH_V4L=ON -D WITH_QT=ON -D WITH_OPENGL=ON ..
make -j4 
sudo make install 


## Eigen3
Required by g2o (see below). 
step1:
Download and install  at: http://eigen.tuxfamily.org. **Required at least 3.1.0**.

step2:
cd eigen
mkdir build
cd build
cmake 
make -j4
sudo make install

sudo cp -r /usr/local/include/eigen3/Eigen /usr/local/include 


## DBoW2 and g2o (Included in Thirdparty folder)
We use modified versions of the [DBoW2](https://github.com/dorian3d/DBoW2) library to perform place recognition and [g2o](https://github.com/RainerKuemmerle/g2o) library to perform non-linear optimizations. Both modified libraries (which are BSD) are included in the *Thirdparty* folder.

## ROS (optional)
We provide some examples to process the live input of a monocular, stereo or RGB-D camera using [ROS](ros.org). Building these examples is optional. In case you want to use ROS, a version Hydro or newer is needed.

### Building the nodes for stereo (ROS)
* Add the path including Examples/ROS/ORB_SLAM2 to the ROS_PACKAGE_PATH environment variable. Open .bashrc file and add at the end the following line. Replace PATH by the folder where you cloned ORB_SLAM2:
    ```
    export ROS_PACKAGE_PATH=${ROS_PACKAGE_PATH}:~/catkin_ws/src/SmarterEye-ORBSLAM2
    ```
* Execute build_ros.sh script:
    ```

  chmod +x build.sh
  ./build.
  chmod +x build_ros.sh
  ./build_ros.sh
    ```

* Launch ORB_SLAM2 Stereo_ROS
Run camera SmarterEye-SDK
    
    ```
    cd <path of SmarterEye-sdk>/wrapper/ros/
    make ros
    source devel/setup.bash
    rosrun zkhy_stereo_d stereo_publisher
    ```

Run ORB_SLAM2, open another terminal and follow the steps.

   rosrun ORB_SLAM2 Stereo ./Vocabulary/ORBvoc.txt ./config/mycamera.yaml false

# 7. ROS Examples

### Building the nodes for mono, monoAR, stereo and RGB-D
1. Add the path including *Examples/ROS/ORB_SLAM2* to the ROS_PACKAGE_PATH environment variable. Open .bashrc file and add at the end the following line. Replace PATH by the folder where you cloned ORB_SLAM2:

  ```
  export ROS_PACKAGE_PATH=${ROS_PACKAGE_PATH}:PATH/ORB_SLAM2/Examples/ROS
  ```
  
2. Execute `build_ros.sh` script:

  ```
  chmod +x build_ros.sh
  ./build_ros.sh
  ```
  
### Running Monocular Node
For a monocular input from topic `/camera/image_raw` run node ORB_SLAM2/Mono. You will need to provide the vocabulary file and a settings file. See the monocular examples above.

  ```
  rosrun ORB_SLAM2 Mono PATH_TO_VOCABULARY PATH_TO_SETTINGS_FILE
  ```
  
### Running Monocular Augmented Reality Demo
This is a demo of augmented reality where you can use an interface to insert virtual cubes in planar regions of the scene.
The node reads images from topic `/camera/image_raw`.

  ```
  rosrun ORB_SLAM2 MonoAR PATH_TO_VOCABULARY PATH_TO_SETTINGS_FILE
  ```
  
### Running Stereo Node
For a stereo input from topic `/camera/left/image_raw` and `/camera/right/image_raw` run node ORB_SLAM2/Stereo. You will need to provide the vocabulary file and a settings file. If you **provide rectification matrices** (see Examples/Stereo/EuRoC.yaml example), the node will recitify the images online, **otherwise images must be pre-rectified**.

  ```
  rosrun ORB_SLAM2 Stereo PATH_TO_VOCABULARY PATH_TO_SETTINGS_FILE ONLINE_RECTIFICATION
  ```
  
**Example**: Download a rosbag (e.g. V1_01_easy.bag) from the EuRoC dataset (http://projects.asl.ethz.ch/datasets/doku.php?id=kmavvisualinertialdatasets). Open 3 tabs on the terminal and run the following command at each tab:
  ```
  roscore
  ```
  
  ```
  rosrun ORB_SLAM2 Stereo Vocabulary/ORBvoc.txt Examples/Stereo/EuRoC.yaml true
  ```
  
  ```
  rosbag play --pause V1_01_easy.bag /cam0/image_raw:=/camera/left/image_raw /cam1/image_raw:=/camera/right/image_raw
  ```
  
Once ORB-SLAM2 has loaded the vocabulary, press space in the rosbag tab. Enjoy!. Note: a powerful computer is required to run the most exigent sequences of this dataset.

### Running RGB_D Node
For an RGB-D input from topics `/camera/rgb/image_raw` and `/camera/depth_registered/image_raw`, run node ORB_SLAM2/RGBD. You will need to provide the vocabulary file and a settings file. See the RGB-D example above.

  ```
  rosrun ORB_SLAM2 RGBD PATH_TO_VOCABULARY PATH_TO_SETTINGS_FILE
  ```
  
# 8. Processing your own sequences
You will need to create a settings file with the calibration of your camera. See the settings file provided for the TUM and KITTI datasets for monocular, stereo and RGB-D cameras. We use the calibration model of OpenCV. See the examples to learn how to create a program that makes use of the ORB-SLAM2 library and how to pass images to the SLAM system. Stereo input must be synchronized and rectified. RGB-D input must be synchronized and depth registered.

# 9. SLAM and Localization Modes
You can change between the *SLAM* and *Localization mode* using the GUI of the map viewer.

### SLAM Mode
This is the default mode. The system runs in parallal three threads: Tracking, Local Mapping and Loop Closing. The system localizes the camera, builds new map and tries to close loops.

### Localization Mode
This mode can be used when you have a good map of your working area. In this mode the Local Mapping and Loop Closing are deactivated. The system localizes the camera in the map (which is no longer updated), using relocalization if needed.
